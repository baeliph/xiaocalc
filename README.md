## How to Use
Install required packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

To run the file, you can run either `python3 .` or `python3 __main__.py` from within the repo.

Weapon charts will be printed to your terminal, and weapon charts and substat distribution CSVs will be saved in `charts/` and `substats/`.

## Disclaimer
The numbers you see here assume perfect rolls for the individual weapons. A true comparison is dependent on your personal artifacts, and because of this some weapons on your Xiao will perform better/worse than what these tables display.

## Assumptions

### Stats
- 10/10/10 90/90 Xiao, t100 enemy with 10% RES.
- Atk/Anemo/Crit DMG artifact main stats.
- Artifact substats use max roll values ([see below for more info](#explaining-substat-rolls)).

### Rotation
- 2 Elemental Skills and 12 High Plunges.

### Weapons
- Calamity Queller has 2 stacks on 1st plunge, 3 stacks on 2nd plunge, 5 stacks on 3rd plunge, and max stacks for the rest.
- Staff of the Scarlet Sands has 1 stack for the second Skill and 2 stacks for plunges 1-7.
- 100% Passive Uptime taken for Shifting Windblade (On)

### Buffs
- Bennett: 865 Base T13. Duration: 7 plunges.
- TTDS: Duration: 7 plunges.
- 4pc NO: Duration: 7 plunges.
- Zhongli and C2/C6 Faruzan: Full uptime.

## Explaining Substat Rolls
- Simulated manually via the 'damage' section on each subs page to find best DPR (damage per rotation). Balanced between Atk%, Crit Rate and Crit Damage, and capped at a maximum of 100% Crit Rate.

- Artifacts are based on 20/25 rolled stats, assuming best possible sub rolls per weapon.

- Results in `charts/` and `substats/` are taken for 4pc Vermillion Hereafter.

- Other stats (e.g. HP, DEF, EM, ER), unless otherwise specified, will be ignored.
  - There is an option `extra_er_subs` that you can set to `True` in order to give all ER weapons 5 extra subs.

- All rolls are based on culminative amount of all 5 Artifacts with an expected outcome depending on how many substats were selected. Refer to bullet 2.
